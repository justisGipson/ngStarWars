RED BADGE INITIAL ASSESSMENT
**************************
​
Create an angular application (clean out the boilerplate stuff) that has a dropdown for these values:
​
People 
Ships 
Films 
​
Then create a input field that a user can put in a search term
​
Then a button that sends a service action that sends a get request to this url (as an example for the people API)
​
https://swapi.co/api/people/?search=r2
​
Make the dropdown values (people, ships, films) fit into the api with on click, and the r2 as the search term in the box
​
Show the data that comes back from the api as a list
​
This does not need to be deployed.
